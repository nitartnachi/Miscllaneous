/*
 * This is a follow up of Shortest Word Distance. The only difference is now you are given the list of words and your method will be called repeatedly many times 
 * with different parameters. How would you optimize it? Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and implements a method that 
 * takes two words word1 and word2 and return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.
 * For example,
 * Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].
 * Given word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”, return 3.
